- Make sure transform_tolerance doesn't break anything (Maybe, it should be a much smaller value)
- Check if `odometry/imu_incremental` actually incremental after a loop closure
- Integrate a fork that supports 6DOF IMU

- Think on how to estimate the uncertainties of the odometry

Some Facts:
- Doesn't work at all without IMU
